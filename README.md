# Pentest
A collection of pentesting tools and my notes for the OSCP preparation. It does not want to be the only resource you should use nor does it pretend to be sufficient for pentesting. It is a mere collection of public tools (not all are installed by default on linux distros) I use in preparation for the OSCP and hope will make the life of any aspiring pentester like myself easier. Many thanks to all the contributors of these awesome tools!

# How to install

1. Run `chmod +x setup.sh` to make the script executable
2. Execute script using `./setup.sh`
3. After installation is complete, `cd` to your desired output folder for the tools
4. Run `cherrytree` and open the notes_oscp.ctb file in order to see all the notes
4. Have fun with it!
