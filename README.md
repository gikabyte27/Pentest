# Pentest
A collection of pentesting tools, notes and exploits. This repo does not want to be the only one you should use nor does it pretend to be sufficient for pentesting. It is a mere collection of public tools (not all are installed by default on linux distros) I use in preparation for the OSCP and hope will make the life of any aspiring pentester like myself easier. Many thanks to all the contributors!

# How to install

1. Run `chmod +x setup.sh` to make the script executable
2. Execute script using `./setup.sh`
3. After installation is complete, `cd` to your desired output folder
4. Have fun with it!
